## Notes

* Currently we don't have a maintainer for the Blackbox, hence it is receiving resuscitation only.

* Rotorflight-2 is **NOT** backward compatible with RF1. You **MUST NOT** load your configuration dump from RF1 into RF2.

* If coming from RF1, please setup your helicopter from scratch for RF2. Follow the instructions on the website!
